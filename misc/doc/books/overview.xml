			<p>Activity Manager is a project management tool. It helps a project
				leader to manage and check his collaborators activity. Simple to use,
				lightweight, but very efficient and customizable !</p>
			<p>Activity Manager is open source software. You can use it
				and redistribute it freely (see <a href="legal" type="book-ref">legal</a>
				for more details).</p>
			<p>The tool's features are :
				<ul>
					<li>Durations repository administration</li>
					<li>Collaborators repository administration</li>
					<li>Tasks repository administration</li>
					<li>Contributions management (=activity management)</li>
					<li>Extensible report facility (with built in templates)</li>
					<li>XML database export/import</li>
					<li>EXCEL export</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>The application allows to build and maintain a hierarchical task
				tree. It works with a very simple database model that allows
				to build quicly custom reports through the report facility or
				through simple SQL requests. Activity Manager is customizable.</p>
			<p>Coded in Java, Activity Manager can be used in three different modes :
				<ul>
					<li>Standalone mode (with an embeded HSQL database)</li>
					<li>MySQL Server mode</li>
					<li>Custom mode (user defined database for skilled users)</li>
				</ul>
				Custom mode may require advanced java notions, like CLASSPATH
				manipulation, particulary if you wish to use a database which is
				different from MySql and HSQL.
			</p>
			<p>It has been tested on Windows XP and Mandrake Linux 9.1 (GTK) and
				may work with any version of MySQL.
